Analysis:
After administering the survey to three friends, several patterns emerged regarding their knowledge and attitudes toward smartphone privacy.
Most respondents were familiar with location services, though few fully understood how their location data is shared with apps and advertisers. None of them knew what a MAID (Mobile Advertising ID) was, showing a clear gap in understanding of how personal data is tracked and linked to advertising profiles.
All participants recognized that targeted advertising exists, but only one actively tried to limit it by adjusting ad preferences or using privacy tools. The others accepted it as “normal” or “unavoidable,” reflecting a sense of resignation toward data tracking.
When asked about school monitoring, two participants suspected that their school tracked browsing activity on school Wi-Fi but weren’t sure how that data was used. This indicates a lack of transparency from institutions and a general uncertainty among students about surveillance practices.
Regarding privacy habits, most reported that they “rarely” checked privacy settings. Despite this, all rated their concern about smartphone privacy at a 3 or higher, suggesting a disconnect between awareness and action.
Overall, the results show that while people express moderate concern about privacy, they often lack specific knowledge about how their data is collected and used. Education on terms like MAID, tracking permissions, and institutional monitoring could help users make more informed decisions about protecting their information.
