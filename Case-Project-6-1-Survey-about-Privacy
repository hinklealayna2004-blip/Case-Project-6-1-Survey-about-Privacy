Smartphone Privacy Regulations and Surveillance-Based Advertising
As smartphones have become essential to daily life, companies like Apple and Google collect massive amounts of user data through apps, sensors, and tracking technologies. Regulators and government entities have increasingly pressured these companies to change how user data is handled, particularly regarding surveillance-based advertising. Despite progress, current privacy laws remain inconsistent and often inadequate to protect users from the complex data collection systems operating behind the scenes.
In the United States, there is no single comprehensive federal privacy law. Instead, privacy protection is governed through a patchwork of sector-specific and state-level regulations. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) uses its authority under the FTC Act to penalize unfair or deceptive data practices (Federal Trade Commission, 2024). Additionally, several states—such as California (CPRA), Virginia (CDPA), and Colorado—have enacted privacy laws giving consumers limited rights to access, delete, or restrict the sale of their data (White & Case LLP, 2024). However, these laws differ from state to state, creating confusion and loopholes for companies that operate nationwide. The proposed American Privacy Rights Act of 2024 seeks to establish a national framework but has yet to be enacted (U.S. Congress, 2024).
In contrast, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides a stronger and more comprehensive approach. It requires explicit consent before collecting or sharing personal data and imposes steep penalties for violations (European Commission, 2024). The EU’s newer Digital Markets Act (DMA) and Digital Services Act (DSA) go further by limiting how large tech companies can use personal data for targeted advertising (Inside Privacy, 2024). Despite these protections, enforcement remains inconsistent, and some companies continue to exploit loopholes such as “consent or pay” models (Wired, 2024).
Overall, while privacy regulations have improved, they are still not adequate to fully protect smartphone users. Many people remain unaware of how much data is being collected about them, and regulators often struggle to keep up with rapidly evolving technology. To strengthen privacy protection, a federal U.S. privacy law is necessary to create uniform standards. Regulations should also restrict behavioral tracking, ban the sale of sensitive location data, and require transparency in how data is shared with advertisers. Finally, companies should adopt privacy-by-design principles, ensuring that devices and apps default to the most privacy-protective settings.
In conclusion, protecting user privacy requires both stronger legal frameworks and more responsible corporate behavior. Until laws catch up with technology, users will continue to face significant risks from surveillance-based advertising and hidden data collection practices.
